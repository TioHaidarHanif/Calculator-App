The application will be deployed on GitHub Pages and will support offline functionality.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the system requirements for the web-based calculator project, including user interface design, functional requirements, performance considerations, and technology stack. The system will be built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- Developers
- Project managers
- Testers
- End-users

### 1.4 Definitions
- **User**: The person interacting with the calculator.
- **Operator**: A mathematical symbol used to perform calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

## 2. System Overview

The calculator system is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The system is designed with speed and user experience in mind and will be responsive across multiple devices and browsers.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 System Architecture
The calculator system consists of the following components:
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the calculator, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles all the logic, including input processing and arithmetic calculations.
- **Service Worker**: Enables offline functionality by caching necessary files.

### 3.2 Components
- **User Interface (UI)**: Displays the calculator buttons and screen for showing results.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Processes user input and performs calculations.
- **Service Worker**: Handles caching for offline access.

---

## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1 Wireframes
The user interface consists of the following elements:
- A display area to show the input and result.
- Buttons for numbers (`0-9`), operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and control buttons (e.g., `=` and `C`).

### 4.2 Design Elements
- The calculator will have a simple and clean design.
- It will be responsive, working seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 5. Data Flow and Control Flow

### 5.1 Data Flow
1. User inputs numbers via button clicks.
2. JavaScript stores the input values and operators.
3. When the user presses the `=` button, JavaScript processes the input and performs the necessary calculations.

### 5.2 Control Flow
1. User clicks buttons to provide input.
2. JavaScript listens for events (e.g., button clicks) and processes the input.
3. The result is updated on the display after the calculation is performed.

## 6. User Stories

### User Story 1: Input Numbers
- **As a user**, I want to input numbers into the calculator using a simple and clear interface so that I can perform calculations.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The number buttons (0-9) should be easy to click.
    - When a number is clicked, it should appear in the display area.

### User Story 2: Select Operators
- **As a user**, I want to select different mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) so that I can perform various types of calculations.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - There should be buttons for `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
    - When an operator is selected, it should update the display or be prepared for the next input.

### User Story 3: Perform Calculations
- **As a user**, I want to perform calculations by clicking the "=" button so that I can see the result of the operation.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - After entering numbers and selecting an operator, clicking the "=" button should show the correct result in the display area.
    - The result should be instantly displayed without delay.

### User Story 4: Clear Input
- **As a user**, I want to clear my current input and start a new calculation so that I can correct any mistakes or start over.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - There should be a "C" or "Clear" button.
    - Clicking the clear button should reset the display and clear the current calculation.

### User Story 5: Handle Errors
- **As a user**, I want the calculator to handle errors gracefully so that I understand when I input something incorrectly (e.g., division by zero).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - If the user tries to divide by zero, the calculator should display an error message like "Error" or "Invalid Operation."
    - The calculator should not crash or behave unexpectedly.

### User Story 6: Offline Support
- **As a user**, I want the calculator to work even if I lose my internet connection so that I can continue using it offline.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The calculator should load and function without an active internet connection after the first visit.
    - Basic calculations should work offline as they do online.

### User Story 7: Mobile-Friendly Design
- **As a user**, I want the calculator to be usable on my mobile device so that I can perform calculations easily on the go.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The calculator should have a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
    - Buttons and display should be easy to use on smaller screens.

---

## 7. Performance Considerations

- **Calculation Speed**: The calculator should instantly perform calculations when the `=` button is clicked.
- **Optimization Strategies**: JavaScript code will be optimized for performance to ensure smooth interaction, especially on mobile devices.

---

## 8. Offline Functionality

The calculator will support offline usage through the implementation of a service worker. The service worker will cache HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, enabling the application to function without an internet connection.

---

## 9. Security and Accessibility

### 9.1 Security
- The application will not handle sensitive data but will follow best practices to avoid security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS).

### 9.2 Accessibility
- The calculator will be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines for web content accessibility.

---

## 10. Technology Stack

### 10.1 Tools and Libraries
- **HTML**: For building the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For implementing the logic.
- **Service Worker**: For enabling offline capabilities.

### 10.2 Compatibility
The calculator will be compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, and will be tested across different screen sizes for responsiveness.

---

## 11. Deployment

The calculator will be deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access and will include service worker support for offline functionality.
