# System Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
To define the design and architecture for a basic web-based calculator application that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This document outlines the system components, user interface, data flow, technology stack, and other relevant aspects.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture
The calculator will be a single-page web application consisting of:
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for functionality.
- **Offline Support**: Implemented using service workers to enable offline access.

### 2.2 Components
- **UI Components**:
  - **Buttons**: For operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and numeric inputs.
  - **Display Area**: To show the current input and result.
- **Functional Modules**:
  - **Calculation Logic**: Handles arithmetic operations based on user input.
  - **Input Handling**: Manages input from buttons and updates the display.

## 3. User Interface Design

### 3.1 Wireframes
- **Layout**: 
  - A grid of buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).
  - A display area at the top to show inputs and results.
  - An equal button to perform calculations and a clear button to reset the calculator.

  Example:
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 0 | . | = |
| + | - | * | / |
| C |

### 3.2 Design Elements
- **Colors**: Use a clean, modern color scheme with high contrast for readability (e.g., light background with dark text).
- **Fonts**: Use legible fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica).
- **Button Sizes**: Ensure buttons are large enough for easy clicking, with sufficient spacing between them.

## 4. Data Flow and Control Flow

### 4.1 Data Flow
- **Input Handling**:
- Capture user input from buttons.
- Update the display with the current input.
- **Calculation Logic**:
- Process arithmetic operations when the equal button is pressed.
- Handle input and operations in a sequence to compute the result.
- **Output Display**:
- Show the result of the calculation on the display area.
- Handle errors (e.g., division by zero) gracefully by displaying error messages.

### 4.2 Control Flow
- **Sequence of Operations**:
1. User clicks a button (number or operator).
2. Update the display with the selected input.
3. User clicks the equal button to perform the calculation.
4. Display the result.
5. User clicks the clear button to reset the input and result.

- **Error Handling**:
- Display an error message if the user attempts invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

## 5. Technology Stack

### 5.1 Tools and Libraries
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core technologies for building the application.
- **Service Workers**: For offline functionality.

### 5.2 Compatibility
- **Browsers**:
- **Chrome**: Ensure full compatibility.
- **Edge**: Ensure full compatibility.
- **Firefox**: Ensure basic functionality.
- **Safari**: Test for compatibility and responsiveness.

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1 Performance Goals
- **Calculation Speed**: Perform calculations instantly upon user input.
- **Optimization**: Ensure minimal load time and responsive UI.

### 6.2 Optimization Strategies
- **Minification**: Minify CSS and JavaScript files for faster loading.
- **Efficient Code**: Write efficient JavaScript code to handle calculations quickly.

## 7. Offline Functionality

### 7.1 Service Workers
- **Implementation**: Use service workers to cache application files and enable offline access.
- **Caching Strategy**:
- Cache essential files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Use a cache-first strategy to serve files from the cache when offline.

## 8. Security and Accessibility

### 8.1 Security
- **Data Handling**: Ensure no sensitive data is handled, as the application is purely for calculations.

### 8.2 Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all functionalities are accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Use ARIA labels to make the calculator usable with screen readers.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.
