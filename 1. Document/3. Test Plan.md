# Test Plan for Web-Based Calculator

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing approach for the web-based calculator project. This includes the scope of testing, test strategy, test objectives, resources, schedule, and responsibilities. The main goal is to ensure that the calculator meets the functional and non-functional requirements defined in the SRS.

### 1.2 Scope
This test plan covers the testing of the following features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- User interaction (button clicks, input handling)
- Offline functionality via service workers
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility
- Performance and usability

## 2. Test Objectives

The main objectives of this test plan are:
- Verify that all calculator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) work correctly.
- Ensure that the user interface is responsive and works across different screen sizes.
- Confirm that the service worker allows the calculator to work offline.
- Validate that the calculator performs calculations efficiently.
- Check for any security or accessibility issues.

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Testing Types
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and modules, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that the different components (UI, logic, service worker) work together as expected.
- **Functional Testing**: Verify that the calculator performs as per the user stories, ensuring the correctness of operations, input handling, and display updates.
- **Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing**: Verify compatibility across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Performance Testing**: Test the responsiveness of the calculator and ensure that calculations are performed quickly.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure there are no security vulnerabilities such as XSS.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure that the application is usable by people with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Ensure that the application meets the userâ€™s needs and expectations as described in the user stories.

## 4. Test Items

The items to be tested include:
- **Calculator Features**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.
- **UI Elements**: Number buttons, operator buttons, clear button, and equals button.
- **Service Worker**: Ensure offline functionality.
- **Responsiveness**: Calculator layout across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Performance**: Response time for calculations.

## 5. Features to be Tested

### 5.1 Functional Features
- **Addition**: Verify that the calculator can correctly add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Verify that the calculator can correctly subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Verify that the calculator can correctly multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Verify that the calculator can correctly divide one number by another (including edge cases such as division by zero).
- **Clear Input**: Ensure the "Clear" button resets the calculator display and stored values.
- **Display Updates**: Ensure that the input and result are displayed correctly in the calculator's display area.

### 5.2 Non-Functional Features
- **Offline Mode**: Ensure the calculator works offline by using the service worker.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the UI is responsive across multiple devices and screen sizes.
- **Performance**: Verify the speed of calculations and UI updates.

## 6. Features Not to be Tested

- **Scientific Calculations**: The calculator only supports basic arithmetic, so scientific calculations (e.g., square roots, exponents) are out of scope.
- **Advanced Input Methods**: Non-numerical inputs like text, characters, or symbols other than arithmetic operators will not be tested.

## 7. Test Approach

### 7.1 Unit Testing Approach
- Each arithmetic function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) will be tested individually by providing various input combinations.
- Edge cases, such as division by zero, will be tested.

### 7.2 Integration Testing Approach
- Verify that clicking the buttons correctly interacts with the arithmetic functions and updates the display.
- Ensure the service worker is integrated properly and functions as expected.

### 7.3 Functional Testing Approach
- Manually simulate user interactions as described in the user stories.
- Automate test cases wherever possible using JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest.

### 7.4 Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing Approach
- The calculator will be manually tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Test on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices to ensure responsiveness.

### 7.5 Performance Testing Approach
- Measure the time taken to perform operations (from button click to result display).
- Ensure the application remains responsive even after extended use.

### 7.6 Security Testing Approach
- Ensure proper sanitization of input to prevent XSS and other client-side vulnerabilities.
- Review the service worker implementation to ensure there are no security flaws.

### 7.7 Accessibility Testing Approach
- Test the calculator using a screen reader.
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Test the color contrast and readability for visually impaired users.

## 8. Test Deliverables

- **Test Cases Document**: A document listing detailed test cases for all identified test items.
- **Test Scripts**: Automated test scripts for unit and functional testing (if applicable).
- **Test Report**: A summary of test results, highlighting any issues or bugs found during testing.
- **Bug Report**: Documentation of any defects found during testing.
